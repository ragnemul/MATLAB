**Inverke Kinematics using Jacobian**

This is a simple script to show how a planar arm can reach a position using Jacobian

The following assumptions are made:

1. The robot is not limited in its movements.
2. The target must be within range of the robot. If 
the target falls out of range, the loop will not end.
3. The original configuration of the robot is painted in blue. 
4. The blue asterisk (*) indicates the target.
5. The plus symbol (+) indicates the effector position.
6. the final configuration is drawn in green
