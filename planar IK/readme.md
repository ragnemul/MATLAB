**Inverke Kinematics using Jacobian**

This is a simple script to show how a planar arm can reach a position using Jacobian

The following assumptions are made
% 1: the robot is not limited in its movements.
% 2: the target must be within range of the robot. If 
% the target falls out of range, the loop will not end.
% The original cofniguration of the robot is painted in blue. 
The blue asterisk (*) indicates the target.
The plus symbol (+) indicates the effector.
% the final configuration is drawn in green
